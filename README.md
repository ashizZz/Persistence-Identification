# Windows Persistence Mechanism Detection Script

This PowerShell script helps identify common Windows persistence mechanisms, including:

- Registry keys (system and user-based)
- Installed services
- Scheduled tasks
- WMI subscriptions
- Startup folders
- Recently written files
- NTFS alternate data streams

It automates checks to detect potential persistence tactics used by threat actors for incident response and threat hunting.
